## 🗂️ Database Schema

The analysis is performed on a single table named `netflix`. The table is created and structured using the following SQL DDL command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);


## 📈 Data Analysis & Findings

    WHERE type = 'Movie' AND duration IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY CAST(SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1) AS INTEGER) DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
* **Insight:** This helps identify outliers in content length. The longest movies are often documentaries or special features.

#### 6. Find content added in the last 5 years
* **Question:** What content has been added to Netflix recently (within the last 5 years)?
* **Query:**
    ```sql
    -- Note: This query uses the current date and might need a fixed date for reproducibility.
    -- The TO_DATE function is specific to PostgreSQL.
    SELECT
        title,
        date_added
    FROM netflix
    WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
    ```
* **Insight:** Analyzing recently added content helps understand Netflix's current acquisition trends and freshness of the library.

* **Question:** Can we list all the works of a specific director, for example, Rajiv Chilaka?
* **Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT title, type, country
    FROM netflix
    WHERE director LIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';
    ```
* **Insight:** This query is useful for talent analysis, allowing stakeholders to see the entire portfolio of a specific director on the platform. Rajiv Chilaka is a prominent director of Indian children's content.

#### 8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons
* **Question:** Which TV shows are long-running (more than 5 seasons)?
* **Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        title,
        duration
    FROM netflix
    WHERE 
        type = 'TV Show'
        AND CAST(SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1) AS INTEGER) > 5
    ORDER BY CAST(SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1) AS INTEGER) DESC;
    ```
* **Insight:** Long-running TV shows often indicate high viewer engagement and loyalty. These are valuable assets for the platform.

#### 9. Count the number of content items in each genre
* **Question:** What are the most popular genres on Netflix?

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        genre,
        COUNT(*) as total_content
    FROM (
        SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ','))) AS genre
        FROM netflix
    ) AS genres
    GROUP BY genre
    ORDER BY total_content DESC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```
* **Insight:** "International Movies," "Dramas," and "Comedies" are the most dominant genres. This data is crucial for content acquisition and scheduling.

        COUNT(*) AS total_releases,
        ROUND(
            COUNT(*)::NUMERIC * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix WHERE country LIKE '%India%'), 2
        ) AS percentage_of_total
    FROM netflix
    WHERE country LIKE '%India%'
    GROUP BY release_year
    ORDER BY total_releases DESC 
    LIMIT 5;
    ```
* **Insight:** The years 2018, 2017, 2019, 2020, and 2016 saw the highest output of Indian content. This indicates a recent surge in production from this region.

* **Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT 
        category,
        type,
        COUNT(*) AS content_count
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            *,
            CASE 
                WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Contains Sensitive Keywords'
                ELSE 'Does Not Contain Sensitive Keywords'
            END AS category
        FROM netflix
    ) AS categorized_content
    GROUP BY category, type
    ORDER BY type, category;
    ```
